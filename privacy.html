			<div class="col-12"><h2 style="color: red;">Privacy Policy</h2></div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-12">
				<p>Geonetric respects the privacy of every individual who visits our website. This privacy statement provides notice of the standards and terms under which Geonetric protects the privacy of information supplied by visitors to sites on the World Wide Web that are owned and operated by Geonetric, including http://www.geonetric.com/.<br><br>

This privacy statement provides notice of our information collection practices and of the ways in which your information may be used. This policy may change periodically.<br><br>

What information does Geonetric collect and how is it used?</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-12"><p><h2 style="color:red;">A. Personally-Identifiable Information</h2>
Geonetric typically receives specific data about its website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services and products, provide resume information for employment opportunities, or send us email. Of course, some of these activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, submit your resume, or request certain types of information.<br><br>

When you provide personally-identifiable information to Geonetric through our website, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want Geonetric to use this information for additional purposes. You may also request that Geonetric not use your information by calling 319.221.1667; however, Geonetric reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you bulletins and other important information about Geonetric services.<br><br>

Absent any instructions from you, Geonetric may use information you provide to inform you about additional services and products offered by Geonetric and other goods and services providers with whom Geonetric has relationships and whose offerings might be of interest to you. Geonetric will not, however, sell or trade your personally-identifiable information unless we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in the case of imminent physical harm to the visitor or others.<br><br>


Where you may provide Geonetric with credit card or other ordering information via the Web, Geonetric protects and secures this information by employing commercially customary Web-based security and encryption protocols, examples of which include Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET).<br><br>


On those sites where you voluntarily offer any feedback, data, answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like, Geonetric will treat that portion of the information as non-confidential and non-proprietary and, except as otherwise expressed in this privacy statement, Geonetric assumes no obligation to protect such information from disclosure.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-12">
				<p><h2 style="color:red;">B. Non Personally-Identifiable (Generic) Information</h2>
In general, Geonetric gathers some generic information automatically. Generic information does NOT reveal the identity of the visitor. It usually includes information about the Internet address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors, and when the Geonetric site was visited. Geonetric gathers this information for the limited purpose of determining customer service and website needs. We accomplish this by using certain technologies, including “cookies” (a technology that can be used to provide the visitor with tailored information about Geonetric services).<br><br>

You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-12"><p><h2 style="color:red;">C. Your Geonetric-hosted website, Modules and Third-Party Sites:</h2>
Information that you disclose in a public space, including any Web module, or website Geonetric may host for you as part of your Geonetric services, is available to anyone else who visits that space. Geonetric cannot safeguard any information you disclose in these locations.<br><br>

Additionally, Geonetric websites can contain links to sites that belong to third-parties unrelated to Geonetric. Geonetric cannot protect any information you may disclose in these sites and recommends that you review the privacy policy statements of those sites you visit.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-12">
				<p><h2 style="color:red;">D. Exceptions and Limitations</h2>
Notwithstanding the foregoing and in compliance with applicable laws, Geonetric (i) cooperates fully with state, local, and federal officials in any investigation relating to any content (including personal or private electronic communications transmitted to Geonetric) or purported unlawful activities of any user of the Service, and (ii) takes reasonable measures to protect its proprietary rights.<br><br>

For the limited purposes of accomplishing such cooperation and measures and in compliance with applicable laws, Geonetric may be required to disclose personally identifiable information.<br><br>

In addition, Geonetric may elect to monitor the areas of communication of any kind (i) to satisfy any law, regulation, or government request; (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate Geonetric; or (iii) to protect the rights or property of Geonetric or others.<br><br>

In connection with the potential sale or transfer of any of its interest in www.geonetric.com and other sites owned by the company, Geonetric reserves the right to sell or transfer your information (including, but not limited to name, address information, and other information you provided to Geonetric) to a third party that (i) concentrates its business in communication products or services; (ii) agrees to be Geonetric’s successor in interest with regard to the maintenance and protection of information collected and maintained by Geonetric; and (iii) agrees to the obligations of this policy statement.</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-12"><p><h2 style="color:red;">Spam Policy</h2>
Geonetric has zero tolerance for Unsolicited Broadcast Email and Unsolicited Commercial Email (“UBE/UCE”, commonly known as “spam”).</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-12"><p>
				<h2 style="color:red;">What is spam?</h2>
The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act requires unsolicited commercial e-mail messages to be labeled (though not by a standard method) and to include opt-out instructions and the sender’s physical address.

It prohibits the use of deceptive subject lines and false headers in such messages.

State laws that require labels on unsolicited commercial e-mail or prohibit such messages entirely are pre-empted, although provisions merely addressing falsity and deception would remain in place. The CAN-SPAM Act took effect on January 1, 2004.

As defined by H.R. 3113 and reported by the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, unsolicited e-mail refers to any electronic message that:
			</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-1"></div>
			<div class="col-11"><p>
				
Advertises a product or service for profit;<br>
Is sent for other commercial purposes;<br>

Is sent to a recipient with whom the initiator does not have an existing business relationship; or<br>

Invites the recipient to view content on an internet website that is operated for a commercial purpose.

		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-12"><p>Geonetric recognizes an e-mail as “spam” if:</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-1"></div>
			<div class="col-11"><p>The recipient is unable to easily unsubscribe from the e-mail list;<br><br>
The transmission contains invalid or forged headers, invalid or non-existent domain names, or other means of deceptive addressing; or<br><br>

In the opinion of the recipient, the transmission and reception of the message appears to give a disproportionate benefit to the sender (not relevant to the individual recipient).</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-12"><p><h3 style="color:red;">What is opt-in vs. opt-out e-mail?</h3>
Opt-in email is a Web marketing term for promotional email that recipients have previously requested by signing up via a website or special ad banner. Typically, Web users are invited to sign up for promotional information about one or more product or service categories. Those who sign up have thus “opted in.”<br><br>

Opt-out email is a Web marketing term for promotional email that recipients have not previously requested by signing up.<br><br>

However, for Geonetric email distributions, the contact’s email address must have been provided to Geonetric by that individual via a Geonetric website, member list, mailing list, conference, or trade show.<br><br>

Individuals who have willingly given Geonetric their contact information via these methods are automatically added to email distribution lists that benefit that individual. Although the individual is added to the email distribution list on the concept of opt-out, the individual is ALWAYS given the opportunity to easily unsubscribe – without being hassled.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-12"><p><h4 style="color:red;">What is Geonetric doing to become “anti-spam?</h4>
Geonetric hopes that individuals find its email communications informative and helpful. However, Geonetric respects the recipient’s wishes for either receiving or not receiving email communications from us.<br><br>

Therefore, Geonetric has adopted the following as procedures for all of its email distribution communications:</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-1"></div>
			<div class="col-11"><p>Valid addressing: The email communication will be sent to a single recipient with the intention of it being received by only one individual. The sender address will be a valid Geonetric email address that is monitored by a Geonetric employee. Therefore the sender address can also be sent email. The sender address will always be an active, working employee of Geonetric.<br><br>
Valid headers/subjects: The email will always have a header or subject that is appropriate and true to the content provided in the communication. The header or subject will not be used inappropriately or give a disproportionate benefit to the sender.<br><br>
Valid contact information: Any contact information in the email will be real and relevant to Geonetric.<br><br>
Valid subscribe/unsubscribe service: The email  will always have the “Geonetric Subscription” information at the end. Geonetric emails and website will always provide information on how to subscribe or unsubscribe to any of its email distribution lists. The process to subscribe and unsubscribe is simple and requires only a few seconds. Geonetric also uses the sender’s email as a means to unsubscribe to any Geonetric communication distribution lists. An email sent to their address is handled personally by our marketing department to meet the satisfaction of the requester, including a confirmation email and follow up call. Geonetric also has a strict privacy policy posted on our website, which addresses the fact that information collected by Geonetric is not sold, but used internally for marketing and telemarketing campaigns.<br><br>
Relevant and beneficial information for the recipient: Geonetric attempts to provide honest information about our company, solutions, products, services, or other information, which we feel, will be in some way relevant and beneficial to the recipient.<br><br>
Mindfulness and compliance with company policies: Geonetric’s email distributions will be mindful and in compliance with its current Privacy Policy as well as its Anti-Spam Policy which is in compliance with current international privacy-policy requirements.</p></div>
